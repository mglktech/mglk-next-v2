*As a Software Developer, I am a strong advocate for open-source software.*

---
## **mglk.tech** is a service that I created to help me learn and grow as a Web Developer.

*I learned how to create this repository using Freely accessible services from YouTube, Stack Overflow, nodejs.org, and other related internet forums.*

*That's why I have decided to publish this repository*


*If you can find anything useful from my code, good on you. Feel free to mention me, or don't, it's completely up to you!*
